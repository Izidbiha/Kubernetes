# Kubernetes Projects

Welcome to my Kubernetes projects repository! This repository contains various Kubernetes deployment examples and configurations for different applications and services.

## Introduction

This repository is designed for Kubernetes enthusiasts and professionals looking to deploy various applications and services in Kubernetes clusters. It includes detailed instructions and configuration files for deploying different components like the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana), CoreDNS, and more.

## Projects

### 1. EFK Stack

The EFK stack is used for logging and monitoring in Kubernetes. It consists of:

- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
- **Fluentd**: A log collector that helps unify log data collection and consumption.
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool that works with Elasticsearch to visualize data logs.

### 2. CoreDNS

CoreDNS is a DNS server that is easily integrated with Kubernetes clusters. It serves as the default DNS server in Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying any projects, ensure you have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or a managed cluster like GKE, EKS, or AKS)
- kubectl CLI tool installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster
- Helm (for projects that require it)
## Installation
